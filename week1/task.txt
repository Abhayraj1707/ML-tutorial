Good Morning Everyone! 
Now that everyone are well aware of the basics of python and some common python libraries used in ML. We will be starting off with the basics of machine learning i.e. Linear regression, it is simple maths of curve fitting. Go through the following lectures and some blog links are posted as well. 
Best of Luck!
