Week 0 :

Before we jump into the
main course of Machine Learning, itâ€™s time for a little bit of warm-up. So most of the coding work related to machine learning is done on Python script. For that we have introduced week 0 which is solely dedicated to improve or get started with Python. We have provided a free course link here.

A brief overview regarding the course :

1.It's a 5 module course with video lectures, which can be downloaded by links they have provided.
2. Short programming questions are there ,try to complete them and sumit them.

Among the libraries introduced we'll focus on two of them in Week 0 i.e Numpy and Matplotlib.

So guys,we would recommend you to install Anaconda and use an IDE called Jupyter notebook in it to code in python.
You can also go for just downloading Python but the above option will be wayyyy useful when you'll be doing projects.

For windows users watch the video to install Anaconda, Python, Jupyter:
